# Panacea-Final
What are we building?

Platform on which one can sell his/her unused near- expiry(1-3 months before) medicines to one in  need of it at cheaper rates .

Or we can say it is as an OLX of medicines. :P

Why are we developing it –

* 1.5% lost on total expenditure every year by expiry of big pharma’s medicines.

* Biggest loss to company – as already paid taxes and duties on expired stock to government

which can’t be claimed back.

* Disposal of unused and life-expired medicines affects environment.

* According to American Government, $374 spent last year on drugs / medicines.

If only 5-10% of it can be saved in any way then it can give boost of $37.4 billion to

American economy. (Almost same stats for Indian)

What would we get from it?

*It would provide cheap rate medicines to the person in need as compared to the market prices.

*The unused medicine of people who were going to throw it away, got sell and they earned

less but significant money from it.

* A big cross to 1.3% loss of big pharmacy companies.

* Also saved a little but significant amount of environment.

Cheers to all ....
